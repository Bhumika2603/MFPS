### Data

The pregnancy report dataset consists of 6262 data points, with each datapoint having 135 features.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

Observations:
-Dataset have features with following datatypes : datetime64[ns](12), float64(62), int64(16), object(45)
-There are 32 empty features which we drop from the dataset for further analysis.After dropping them,we get a dataset with 6262 data points with each having 103 features.
